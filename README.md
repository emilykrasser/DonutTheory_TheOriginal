## [Final Artist Statement](https://github.com/emilykrasser/DonutTheory/blob/master/EmilyKrasser_FinalArtistStatement.pdf)

## Do you still think there is nothing to Donut Theory?
"Dr. Satellite has accidently taken donut theory too far, opening a rift to a strange mutant donut universe. Now these delicious but weird creatures are having an effect on the environment around them, whether good or bad. Play as Dr. Satellite to figure out what these donuts want and to possibly delay the inevitable end of all donuts (and universes)."
